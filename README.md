# ArgueAI
SOC IITB project-ArgueAI
Basic Idea: (My part): Reinforcement learning
1. Make a environment consisting of all the rules or arguments, actions and rewards.
2. Make two agent which select the relevent argument based on their training.
3. We will have a judge, who decides what is correct and gives awards.
4. Integrate all of it

Basics of RL:
1. Studied neural networks.
here is a basic test program implemented: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Io6fGDTq6WtTzju1zJilC6LFjACD86c8?usp=sharing
2. Studing DQN and basic environment making.
This is something i tried refering to the material provided(still understanding its working): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17RPVRc3SBKetyw36glnfzE3HrLACsvMb?usp=sharing
